# LOTRO Chat Translator

This is a simple Python program that uses the Google Translate API to translate your chats in real-time!

It has only been tested with World Chat and IMs.

For World Chat, you need to go to your settings and enable Chat Timestamps.

Then, right-click the World Chat tab, select Chat Logging, and choose Start Logging.

Open LOTROChatTranslator.exe, then:

- Select "1- for World Chat"
- Go to: `C:\Users\YOURUSER\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online`
- Drag and drop your `World_#######_#.txt` log file into the LOTROChatTranslator.exe window.
- Hit Enter.
- Type one of the available languages and hit Enter.
- Your World Chat will now start to be translated into your desired language in real-time. :)

For IMs, the process is similar to World Chat:

- Start an IM with someone.
- Right-click the IM tab, select Chat Logging, and choose Start Logging Playername.
- Go to: `C:\Users\YOURUSER\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online`
- Drag and drop your `IMs_Playername_######_#.txt` log file into the LOTROChatTranslator.exe window.
- Hit Enter.
- Type one of the available languages and hit Enter.
- You can now chat with your foreign friend. :)

You can also use QuickTranslator.exe for a quick Google Translate on your PC!
