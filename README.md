- **IMs Chat:** Translate only Instant Messages (IMs).

### Step 4: Set Up the Log File Path

- **Path to the log file:** Paste the path to your `log file.txt` or click the "Browse" button to use Windows File Explorer and select your log file.

### Step 5: Configure Language Settings

- **Chat:** Choose the language you want the chat to be translated into.
- **Translator:** Select the language for translating what you type in the Translator box.
- **Translated Text:** The translated text will appear here. You can then use `Ctrl + V` to paste it directly into LOTRO chat—no need for manual copying.

### Step 6: Save Your Settings

Once you’ve set up your languages and log path, go to `Menu -> Save Settings`. The translation process will then run in a loop, translating all new messages logged in the file.
